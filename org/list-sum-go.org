* tests to run on each definition:

** is it well-formed?
- if text: does it parse?
- if syndir: are there any invalid slots?

** is it implemented?
*** is it refined to an implementation?
*** does it refer to any undefined names?

** are the refinement steps valid?

** do the tests pass?
- do examples give expected results?


* general principles
- write proofs about algorithms
- then refine the implementation at lower levels
(e.g.: you know it works, now implement it with this data structure in this language...)
